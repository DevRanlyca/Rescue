#  **Welcome to Rescue!

Indonesia is home to approximately 250 million stray cats, most resides in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia. However most people in Jakarta never really paid attention to really care for them, along with their needs and living conditions, especially for young kittens. During the pandemic, I rescued a 3 week old kitten and had the privilege to raise her to an adult cat. Through this experience, I learn that kittens have different types of nutritional needs and food as they’re growing up, along with how frequent they’re supposed to be fed. That’s why I was inspired to create this app project, to share my experience of rescuing stray kittens and provide information on how to raise them, especially newborn ones.

## **About the Project

**Rescue** is a interactive simulation mini game that gives information and experience to care for young kittens in 3 life stages from 0 to 10 weeks old. In this game, you’ll raise Abu, a stray kitten whom is inspired by my real life rescue kitten with the same name.

Learning and watching her grow up was one of the most rewarding experience to me, and I hope to share that feeling with you through this app project, and to apply the knowledge in real life so you’ll be prepared in a time you might need to rescue a feline friend in the future.
